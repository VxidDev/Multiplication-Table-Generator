# Multiplication Table Generator

A Python program that generates a multiplication table for a number between 1 and 10. Designed to practice loops, input validation, and clean output formatting.

## Features

- Generates multiplication table (1â€“10) for chosen number
- Input validation ensures number is between 1 and 10
- Compact loop logic with clear, readable output
- Basic alignment for improved readability

## How to Use

1. Run the script  
2. Enter a number from 1 to 10  
3. The multiplication table for that number will be displayed  

Example:
```
Input a number: 3
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
...
3 * 10 = 30
```

## Purpose

This project was created to practice:
- **For loops** for repeated calculations
- **Conditionals** for validation and formatting
- **User input handling** with `try/except`
- **Clean and simple program structure**

## Usage

Clone the repo and run the script with Python 3:
```bash
python multiplication_table.py
